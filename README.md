3d-squares
==========

Like squares... but 3d!

A very similar game to the original squares. A grid of dots where each player takes a turn in drawing lines between the dots. If a square is drawn, the player who completed the square earns a point and receive another turn.

Imagine that... but 3d! I'll stop that soon. 3d Squares will appear in the same manner, however the lines will be pre-drawn and the player need only select that line. The line will glow golden when selected and if it completes just a square then the player is given a point and a square with their colour is drawn.

If the player can manage to capture a whole cube, extra points are awarded.
